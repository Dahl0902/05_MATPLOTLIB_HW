1. Based on the data Ramicane is the best performing drug of the froup. It had the most mice still alive at the end of the trial period, it had the lowest average tumor size and no outliers that would skew the data. It's Standard Deviation is on the higher side of this data.

2. Mice weight and tumor volume have a positive correlation. Further information would be needed to determine where the correlation comes from. This could just be a ratio thing, bigger mice have bigger tumors just because they are bigger but there culd be a link to fat tissue in the mice.

3.Based on the timeline of mouse l509, the drugs seem to take some time to start impacting the tumor. It wasn't until the 20 timepoint that the tumor began to shrink. The drug could cause the tumor to grow for a while before shrinking it. This could be an issue if the tumor grows too large and kills the mouse before it can save them. More data from individual mice would be need before any solid conclusion could be made.
